        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Defenders of Wildlife, founded in 1947, is a leading U.S. conservation organization dedicated to safeguarding
          native animals and plants and their habitats. They advocate for policy reforms, employ scientific expertise,
          and engage in wildlife management to protect imperiled species across North America. With a multi-pronged
          approach, they influence decision-making in various arenas, including Congress, courts, and public discourse.
          Their field offices enable community engagement and practical conservation solutions. Supported by members and
          partners, Defenders of Wildlife strives to be a potent and enduring force for wildlife conservation, employing
          knowledge, advocacy, and public support to ensure the preservation of natural ecosystems.</p>

        <h3>Our Conservation Vision</h3>
        <p>Defenders of Wildlife envisions secure and thriving wildlife populations across North America, supported by
          healthy lands and waters. They prioritize protecting a diverse range of species, including migratory ones, and
          recognize the interdependence of species and habitats. Their goal is to ensure vulnerable species rebound and
          flourish in well-distributed populations, free from the threat of rapid decline or extinction. Achieving this
          vision requires a transnational network of both public and private lands, rivers, coastal waters, and working
          landscapes. Through targeted conservation efforts, Defenders of Wildlife aims to create a sustainable future
          where wildlife and ecosystems thrive harmoniously.</p>
